# tree-gen
Blender plugin produced as part of my undergraduate dissertation: [Procedural generation of tree models for use in computer graphics](https://chewitt.me/Papers/CTH-Dissertation-2017.pdf).

Thanks to the awesome work of [Luke Pflibsen-Jones](https://github.com/luketimothyjones) you can just drop the ch_trees folder into your blender addons folder and enable the plugin in user settings to start generating trees! Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen/archive/master.zip). Or try out the new interface which allows you to fully customise the tree generation process (currently in beta) [here](https://github.com/luketimothyjones/tree-gen/archive/parameter-customizer.zip). Currently support Blender 2.7 only.
